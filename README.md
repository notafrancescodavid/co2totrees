# co2totrees

This app is made for the Carbon Negative Non-profit association. The app is open source and has the goal
of making users see how many trees they would need to absorb all their lifetime Co2 and become Carbon Negative.

The app also gives additional information in the form of charts:

1. Cumulative lifetime Co2 emissions
2. Cumulative lifetime Co2 emissions - Cumulative lifetime absorbed Co2 emissions
3. Cumulative absorbed Co2 emissions by nature sinks per capita
4. Cumulative absorbed Co2 emissions by the imagined planted trees (given by the user as input)

Finally, the app gives some easy-to-follow suggestions on how to cut Co2 emissions.

The app is made in Next.js 15 and React 19.
Below the instructions on how to run it.

In case you are interested on the main calculation you can check the /lib/Co2ToTreesCalculator.ts class.
