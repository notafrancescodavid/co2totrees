        "item2Content2": "Survival Rate: each year 80% of trees will survive, hence they 20% that do not are removed from the calculation. (This assumption is optimistic, generally global survival rate of planted trees is around 70%)",

        "item3Content1": "In the calculator the amount of Co2 you produce decreases each year until a maximum yearly reduction of 8%. This assumes emissions reduction will continue in most heavily emitting sectors globally like energy production, aviation and agriculture. (This assumption is optimistic, as emissions are unfortunately still rising globally).",
        "item3Content2": "The calculation considers a minimum amount of yearly personal emissions of 20% compared to the one you insert in the input. This choice comes from the consideration that there will always be antropogenic sources of emissions that we cannot avoid.",
        "item3Content3": "Different trees in different places absorb different amounts of Co2. This calculation considers an average absorbtion based on tree size, assuming most planted trees are small when fully grown (e.g. olive trees) and some others are medium or big (e.g. quercus or sequoia)."
